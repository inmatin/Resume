              Inventory System– Data Structures (Java)<br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designed and fully tested a java which maintains a grocery
                  store inventory, based on the number of items and type added
                  and removed from the inventory as well as updated price
                  value(the more items of certain type in stock the lower the
                  pricing).<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  Program allows for user to search for a specific item in the
                  inventory. A positive match results in the name of the item,
                  stock quantity and pricing to be displayed.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The program can receive information directly from the user or
                  by reading a text document to update the inventory. Full
                  inventory details can be printed to a text document as
                  well.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The inventory itself was created using an Array list for
                  efficiency and the item search was done using a comparator.<br />
                </li>

              3D Printable Object - Object Oriented Programming (Java)<br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designed and fully tested java program code which fully prints
                  a 3D Object using a 3D printer.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  Code was adjusted to meet STL specifications and format<br />

                </li>
                <li>
                  Shape design was achieved using basic mathematical and
                  object-oriented programming concepts.<br />

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designed and fully tested a Shell Script program which can
                  perform addition, subtractions, division, multiplication, and
                  remainder operations.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The program is menu based, where the user must first choose
                  what operation they wish to use. <br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The program is designed to use 5 functions, one for each
                  operation and each function takes in 5 parameters.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The program runs in a loop unless stopped by the user at the

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designed and fully tested a database with 6 entities and 10

                </li>
                <li>
                  Database was normalized to Boyce-Codd Normal Form using
                  principles of partial functional dependency, transitive
                  dependency and functional dependency.<br />
                </li>
                <li>A back up of the database was created.<br /></li>
                <li>
                  Part of the project involved writing various queries, such as
                  joins, unions, where statements, groups and sub queries.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  An index was also created for 3 columns of 2 entities that
