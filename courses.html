              further study in the field. Students develop introductory
              knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on problem
              analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML
              Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java programming language
              used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Through an
              introduction to the Java programming language students use
              sequential structures, selection structures, repetition
              structures, variables, constants, methods, constructors,
              one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes,

              functions. Students investigate computer number systems in
              addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems
              involving computer systems. Students also study the addition and
              subtraction of vectors using vector components. Delivered in a
              modular format, this course is equivalent to the completion of all
              of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D, E, F, and L.
